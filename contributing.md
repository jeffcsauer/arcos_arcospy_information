# Contributing

Contributions are welcome to both `arcos` and `arcospy`. For major contributions, please fork the master `arcos` or `arcospy` branch and then open a pull request with the suggested changes. We will then review the change and determine if there is a generalizable solution to both `R` and `Python`. If there is no generalizable solution, we will still strive to make your contribution visible on the respective Github page.

## Documentation

Improvements to the documentation for `arcos` and `arcospy` are welcome. As stated above, we will try to generalize all contributions to both packages. For example, if the wording around a specific command is unclear, we can improve the wording in both packages. Additionally, if there are features of a command that you believe should be included in the primary documentation, please let us know so we can improve the user experience.

## Code

Presently, the core functionality of the API is maintained by the Data Reporting Team at *The Washington Post*. There is ample room for users to suggest functions that can be added to `arcos` and `arcospy`. For example, users might suggest functions that download national or regional sets of data by looping existing commands.

## Issues

Trackable issue pages are available on both the master `arcos` or `arcospy` Github pages. Issues may be related to anything from malfunctioning commands to inconsistent data. We encourage an active discussion and hope to readily address any errors. We recommend that when submitting an issue users provide specific tags and examples of the aberrant behavior. If you are able to solve an issue with the code independently, please open a pull request with the corrected code and a short explanation as to the bug fix.
