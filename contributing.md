# Contributing

Contributions are welcome to both `arcos` and `arcospy`. For major contributions, please fork the master `arcos` or `arcospy` branch and open a pull request with the suggested changes. The appropriate team will then review the changes and determine if there is a generalizable solution to both `R` and `Python`. If there is no generalizable solution we will strive to make your contribution visible on the appropriate Github page.

## Documentation

Improvements to the documentation for `arcos` and `arcospy` are welcome. As stated above, we will try to generalize all contributions to both packages. For example, if the description or working for a specific command is unclear we can improve in both packages. Additionally, if there are features of a command that you think should be included in the documentation, please let us know so we can improve the user experience.

## Code

Presently, the core functionality of the API is maintained by the Data Reporting Team at *The Washington Post*. There is ample room for users to suggest functions that can be added to `arcos` and `arcospy`. For example, users might suggest functions that download national or regional sets of data by looping existing commands.

## Issues

Trackable issue pages are available on both the `arcos` and `arcospy` Github pages. Issues may be related to anything from malfunctioning commands to inconsistent data. We encourage an active discussion and hope to readily address any errors. We recommend that when submitting an issue users provide specific tags and examples of the aberrant behavior. If you are able to solve an issue with the code independently, please open a pull request with the corrected code and a short explanation for the bug fix.
